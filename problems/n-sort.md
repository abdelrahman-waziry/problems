# sort the list in O(n) time.

Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by **Google**:

Given a list of numbers with only 3 unique numbers `(1, 2, 3)`, sort the list in `O(n)` time.

## Example:
```
Input: [3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1]
Output: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
```

```python
def sortNums(nums):
  # Fill this in.

print sortNums([3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1])
# [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
```
