# Introduction 
This project is our initiative to help archive Interview questions, answers and illustrations. The main questions source is the [Daily interview Pro](https://www.techseries.dev/daily) Mail list.
 
You do not have to solve problems daily but solve as much as you can.

# Contribute to Problems

Each problem is added in a separate `problem-title-slug.md` file inside the `root/problems` directory. 

You can add any problem asked by any company in the following format: 
---

**Example**
`{exampleIinput1}` should return `{exampleOutput1}` since `{reason1}`.
`{exampleIinput2}` should return `{exampleOutput2}` since `{reason2}`.

**Function signature**
```python
def func_name(input)
# Fill this is

```python
print func_name(input1)
# ExpectedOutput1
```

```python
